Jupyterhub
==========

Jupyterhub uses Gitlab for authentication.

* If you don't have a Gitlab account, you'll need to create one.
* If your Gitlab account is not part of the SKAO group,
  ask on the ``#team-system-support`` Slack channel for it to be added.

Once you have your auth sorted out, here is a link to the Jupyterhub interface:

* `AAVS3 Jupyterhub`_

That link takes you to an introductory Jupyter notebook,
which demonstrates some basic interaction with the subrack and TPMs.
You can experiment with that notebook,
and you can also create your own notebook.
